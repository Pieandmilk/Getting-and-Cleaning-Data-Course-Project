Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repository contains the work for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The output is a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.

Files in this Repository
run_analysis.R: This is the main R script that performs all the data processing. It takes the raw data from the source and transforms it into a clean, tidy data set.

FinalTidyData.txt: This is the tidy data set generated by the run_analysis.R script. It contains the average of each mean and standard deviation measurement for each activity and each subject.

CodeBook.md: This file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed to clean up the data. It provides a data dictionary for the variables in FinalTidyData.txt.

README.md: This file, which you are currently reading. It provides an overview of the project and explains how the scripts work.

How to Run the Analysis
Prerequisites: You need to have R installed on your system. The script also uses the dplyr package. The script will attempt to install it automatically if it's not found.

Execution:

Place the run_analysis.R script in your desired working directory in R or RStudio.

Run the script using the source("run_analysis.R") command in the R console.

What the Script Does:

Downloads Data: The script first checks for the data source file (dataset.zip). If not present, it downloads the data from the web.

Unzips Data: It then checks if the data directory (UCI HAR Dataset) exists. If not, it unzips the downloaded file.

Loads Data: It reads the training data, test data, feature names, and activity labels into R.

Merges Data: It combines the training and test sets into a single data frame.

Extracts Measurements: It keeps only the columns related to the mean and standard deviation of measurements.

Applies Descriptive Names: It replaces the activity codes (1-6) with their descriptive names (e.g., "WALKING", "SITTING").

Labels Variables: It cleans up the column names to make them more readable and descriptive.

Creates Tidy Dataset: It calculates the average of each variable for each combination of subject and activity.

Outputs File: It writes this final tidy data set to a file named FinalTidyData.txt in the working directory.

Source Data
The data used for this project was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description of the original data is available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The data for the project was downloaded from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
